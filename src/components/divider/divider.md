        Morphological changes in the small airway epithelium are the first histopathological
        manifestations of smoking-induced lung disease. Gene expression profiling using microarrays
        has permitted the identification of changes in the small airway epithelium of chronic
        cigarette smokers who have normal pulmonary function.

        The availability of high throughput, massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the
        entire transcriptome opens the possibility of a higher sensitivity and more detailed
        characterization of the response of the small airway epithelium to smoking.
